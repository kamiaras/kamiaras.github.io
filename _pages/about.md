Hello! I'm Kamiar Asgari, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC), fluent in Persian (Farsi) and English. My academic journey began at the Sharif University of Technology in Iran, where I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering. This path has led me to USC, where I have been deeply involved in research under [Prof. Michael J. Neely](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~mjneely/).

My research interests are centered on Convex Optimization with First-Order Oracle for large-scale (dimension) problems. I develop algorithms that avoid computationally costly processes, such as projections. Post-Ph.D., I aspire to continue my research, preferably in the industry, delving into areas like Convex, Online, and Stochastic Optimization, Bandit Algorithms, and the theories of Deep Learning.

In both my professional and personal life, I embrace the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty, a concept I've adopted from studying bandit algorithms. This approach guides my decision-making, encouraging a positive outlook, especially when faced with limited information. I am proficient in probability, convex analysis, Python, and MATLAB. I am familiar with Linux/GNU, Git, and deep learning. Eager to continuously expand my knowledge, I am particularly interested in deepening my understanding of deep learning theory. I welcome collaborations and look forward to connecting with others who share my interests in these dynamic fields.
