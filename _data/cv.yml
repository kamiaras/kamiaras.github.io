    - name: Summary
      value: Kamiar Asgari, currently pursuing his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at USC, is all about making complex optimization problems simpler and more efficient. He started this journey with a B.S. from Sharif University in Iran and now, he's looking to bring his skills into the industry, diving into everything from optimization to deep learning. Kamiar, believes in staying positive even when things get tricky, a lesson he's learned from his research. He's pretty handy with Python and MATLAB, knows his way around Linux/GNU and Git, and is always up for teaming up with others who are just as passionate about pushing the boundaries in deep learning.
