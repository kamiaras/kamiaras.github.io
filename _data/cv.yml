    - Actively participated in community service initiatives through the USC Volunteer Center, focusing on neighborhood cleanup projects in Koreatown.
    - Engaged as a volunteer with The Viterbi Impact Program, contributing to the organization and success of the Viterbi K-12 Center's Annual MESA and Hustle N' Code Hackathon events.
    - I'm a big fan of comedy, especially stand-up! I had such a blast taking the Improv course at USC not once, but twice!
    - Soccer is my favorite sport. Even though my technique isn't perfect, I'm good at understanding the game and playing as a team member.
